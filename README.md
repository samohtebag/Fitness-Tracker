## Description

This is an app built with Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose to track your workouts, either cardio or resistance based.

User Story:

    ```
As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
    ```
